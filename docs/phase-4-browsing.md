# ✅ Phase 4: Browsing & Filtering

### Tasks

* [x] `/api/tracks` – filter by title, artist, genre, album (Currently filters by artistId, albumId, title, genre, etc.)
* [x] `/api/albums` – list albums with art
* [ ] `/api/artists` – list artists and albums (Currently lists only artists)
* [x] `/api/genres` – list unique genres
* [ ] UI:

  * [x] Search bar (Filters album titles in library view)
  * [x] Album grid view
  * [x] Artist discography page (Navigates to filtered album view)
  * [x] Genre tags
* [x] Implement basic audio playback

### Clarification Questions

* Should search use fuzzy matching?
* Should genre display be a list, dropdown, or tag cloud?
* Should we allow favoriting tracks?
