# ✅ Phase 4: Browsing & Filtering

### Tasks

* [ ] `/api/library/tracks` – filter by title, artist, genre, album
* [ ] `/api/library/albums` – list albums with art
* [ ] `/api/library/artists` – list artists and albums
* [ ] `/api/library/genres` – list unique genres
* [ ] UI:

  * Search bar
  * Album grid view
  * Artist discography page
  * Genre tags

### Clarification Questions

* Should search use fuzzy matching?
* Should genre display be a list, dropdown, or tag cloud?
* Should we allow favoriting tracks?
